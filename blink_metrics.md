Out of 10 times that I tested double blink, it worked 9 times. One time it didn't was that it didn't register the double blink.

Out of 10 times that I test triple blink it worked 8 times. One time it didn't register the triple blink at all. The other time it said double blink first then triple blink. So it was technically a false positive for the double blink.

We can honestly keep it, I played around with the numbers for a while and this was the best one.
